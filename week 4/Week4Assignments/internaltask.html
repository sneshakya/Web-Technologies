    <h1>Valorant</h1>
    <img src="Valorant.jpg">
    <p>Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games,
         for Windows. Teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period 
         with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by a release on June 2, 2020. The development of the game 
         started in 2014. Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series of tactical shooters, borrowing
          several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving.</p>
