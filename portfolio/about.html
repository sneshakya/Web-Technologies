    <h1>About Me </h1>
    <p class="intro">I am Sneha Shakya. I am 19 years old and I live in Kalanki, Kathmandu. I am a BIT Student at Herald College Kathamandu. 
        I recently gave my +2 level exam from L.R.I. School which is located in Kalankisthan, Kathmandu. I took Biology Science as a major 
        subject in my highschool.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="hobby">In my free time I love to read books, listen to music, watch new movies, travel to different new places and exploring my 
            creativity with painting and drawing. In highschool I was a prestigious member of the Student Council and was also handed the prestigious 
            position of 'The President of Creative & Arts Club of L.R.I'.</p>
